# Produces the first 100 prime numbers in a table structure.

Assignment 5 Specifications

Due: 3 November 2016 - class time.


Output: Write a class PrimeSequence that implements the Sequence interface class - refer to P10.2 on page 508 in the text. This problem utilizes the Worked Example 10.1 (found on page 473 in the text - go to wiley.com/go/javaexamples for sample downloads). Provide a demo class that will produce a sequence of the first 100 prime numbers in table format - 10 rows and 10 columns - all entries right-aligned. All output should be handled by the demo class.


Input: As required to execute the demo class. Interactive input must be validated. Non-interactive input must clearly demonstrate the proper execution of your class(es) and methods. All input should be handled by the demo class.


Requirements: Use only material covered in the first ten chapters. Style requirements as discussed in class expected. Class design guidelines as discussed in class and described in chapter 8 expected. Import libraries as required.

You should have at least three programs: one will implement the Sequence interface class; one will be the PrimeSequence class that will use the interface; and one SequenceDemo class that will preform the actions required to execute and produce the desired sequence of primes in table format.


Submission: Include program documentation that provides clear instructions for how to compile and execute your program on the FIU SCIS.  Your program must be able to compile and execute on FIU SCIS, using the “java” compiler. 
Efficiency should always be considered. Choose the most appropriate loop/decision structures and variable types. 

Algorithm (pseudocode) should be submitted in a separate text file and included with the Moodle posting and class submission. 
Print out a copy of all source code and both text files and submit in class. Post a .zip file — with all source code files and text files — on the Moodle web site.
Program should include a signed disclaimer (comment) in the heading, as follows:
	"I hereby certify that this collective work is my own and none of it is the work of any other person or entity. "  
Include your name and student id. Class submission must include your signature and be stapled.
